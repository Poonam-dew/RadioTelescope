          <h1>What is RTP?</h1>
          <p className='homePara'>
            The Radio Telescope Project (RTP) is a one-of-its-kind initiative undertaken by students at IIT Roorkee to promote scientific research and development in the field of radio astronomy. It focuses on research by students at educational institutions.
          </p>
          <p className='homePara'>
            Started during the pandemic, the team has come a long way to build working models for the actual 5-meter radio telescope from scratch. The system has been tested with an Affordable Small Radio Telescope (ASRT) to ensure it meets the necessary standards for educational use.

          <h1>History and Engineering</h1>
          <p className='homePara'>
            Radio astronomy, a revolutionary branch of astrophysics, began in the early 1930s. Karl Jansky, a radio engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories, discovered unexpected radio waves emanating from the Milky Way while investigating sources of interference in transatlantic telephone lines. This discovery marked the foundation of an entirely new way of exploring the universe beyond visible light.

          <h1>Working of Radio Telescopes</h1>
          <p className='homePara'>Radio telescopes are a combination of antennas, receivers, amplifiers, and recorders that work together to detect and amplify radio waves from space.</p>
          <h4>Antennas</h4>
          <p className='homePara'>These collect radio waves from space. Most antennas are parabolic dishes that reflect the radio waves to a receiver.</p>
          <h4>Receivers and Amplifiers</h4>
          <p className='homePara'>These boost the weak radio signal to a measurable level. Amplifiers are often cooled to very low temperatures to reduce interference.</p>
          <h4>Recorders</h4>
          <p className='homePara'>These keep a record of the signal.</p>
